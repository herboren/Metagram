# Metagram
Extracts a general subset of metadata from RAW only files, and generates an RGB histogram per image. Useful for Astrophotography beginners. Metadata extraction based on https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor Only key property tags were taken that appeared relevant to the job and help others to identify pertinent information to shooting appropriate frames by identifying the metadata within the files. This would allow the photographer to adjust their camera settings according to the best quality images within this tool.

A series of frames should be shot from chosen focal lengths, at certain ISO's, at certain F/Stops, and exposure times to identify the best quality image for the job to be stacked later. The user can mark at most 3 photos with Good, Better, Best quality when working with larger quantity of files as the naming convention of files generated by the camera can be quite confusing. MetaData for each file is stored within the textbox for easier identification of each photos metadata.

Use a context menu to mark the appropriate files, delete, open file location, or even copy metadata to a formatted string for use in forum threads or personal use. This has only been tested on Canon CR2 formats and few others, however, unsupproted formats are beyond my control and should be addressed with https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor
